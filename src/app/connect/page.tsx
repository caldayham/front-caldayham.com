      <p>To connect with cal (via email, phone, or any other supported message) you must first submit something you find interesting.</p>
      <p>As the number of requests to connect increases, so will the bar for what is interesting enough. I absolutely love talking to new people, but I have the same 24 hours in my day you do and can't spend it all talking to people about things I don't find interesting.</p>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <p>Fill out the form below, no links please, and then explain in less than 2048 characters, something you find interesting.</p>
      <p>I review all submissions and if I find it interesting I will reach out to you via your provided method.</p>

        <p>You can book a 30 minute video call for 200 USD or the current equivalent in bitcoin, maximum 2 / person / week.</p>
        <p>For many people $200 is a non-trivial amount to spend on 30 minutes of time, if you find yourself in that bucket, don't purchase this.</p>
        <p>That said, there are also many people who have a high time value and just want to quickly schedule a call, this product is for those people.</p>
