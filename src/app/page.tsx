            <p>The primary directive of this site is to organize, centralize, and distribute, public information about myself, Cal!</p>
            <p>My current idea to most simply group and display data is through posts. A post has a central topic and contains text, images, models, external links, and any other helpful data display methods I can integrate. I hope to get creative.</p>
            <p>Posts are placed into one of three buckets, thoughts, projects, and lessons. My goal here is to simplify your search based on your goal.</p>
            <p>Finally there is a highly useful page, connect, which has an enjoyable way of contacting me to prevent spam and spur interesting interaction, and a list of all my public profiles.</p>

          <p>I absolutely love problem solving. To me, that seems to be a big component of purpose. I am 22 year old, canadian by birth, straight white male.</p>
          <p>Some other things that I really enjoy are family / friends, being outside, weight lifting, animals, coding, building solutions, and finding new ways to organize various aspects of my being.</p>
          <p>I think a lot about entropy, ultimate purpose in existence, personal agency, and the severity of existence. I am very grateful to be.</p>
          <p>I am quite fortunate to have a wonderful family, great friends, healthy body, and clear mind. I have had my struggles, I am and will continue to have more, I am grateful for existence.</p>
          <p>I subscribe heavily to the 'my-fault' ideology, because even if the situation I find myself in isn't entirely my fault, I would rather take it into my own hands than let someone or something else dictate my boundary conditions.</p>
          <p>Sometimes people seem to forget that we are flying through space on a semi-molten rock, it's time to set bigger goals and take massive action, because why tf not?</p>

        <div className={styles.mainItem}>
          <h1 className={styles.title}>About my Thoughts</h1>
          <p>Take every opinion and statement you read on this site for what it is, text describing the inclinations of a 22 year old male.</p>
          <p>In many areas, I am severely under-exposed, and I'm sure there are many amazing thinkers why have navigated the same or similar questions, possibly with greater clarity and fruitfulness.</p>
          <p>My only goal in organizing and sharing my publicly acceptable thoughts is firstly for myself, to centralize them, and secondly to seed the inquisitions of curious minds who may not have asked themselves these questions.</p>

        <div className={styles.mainItem}>
          <h1 className={styles.title}>About my Projects</h1>
          <p>I love doing stuff, and I often turn the dials up pretty far, it is quite enjoyable to create things, especially new ones.</p>
          <p>If you have any projects you'd like to share with me, I'd love to see them, visit my connect page to learn more.</p>

        <div className={styles.mainItem}>
          <h1 className={styles.title}>About my Lessons</h1>
          <p>I have learned a number of things during my exposure to various aspects of life, many of the lessons I plan to create are / will be taken directly from my folder of lessons I have been assembling for my future children.</p>
          <p>Just as with my thoughts, take these lessons for what they are, likely non-perfect attempts by a 22 year old to share their understanding of the world.</p>

        <div className={styles.mainItem}>
          <h1 className={styles.title}>How to Connect</h1>
          <p>I am still unknown enough to simply provide my email or even phone number and not be inundated with constant messages. That said, I have devised a method of acquiring my contact information that inspires conversation and filters most bad actors.</p>
